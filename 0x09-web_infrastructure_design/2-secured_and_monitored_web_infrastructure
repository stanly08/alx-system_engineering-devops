2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure


1. User Accesses the Website:
A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com securely.
2. DNS Resolution:
The user's computer sends a DNS query to resolve www.foobar.com.
The DNS server returns the IP address associated with www.foobar.com.
3. Server Setup:
We have three servers: Server 1, Server 2, and Server 3.
Each server is equipped with a firewall, SSL certificate, and monitoring client.
Components:
a. Firewalls:
Firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic to and from the servers.
They help enforce security policies, filter malicious traffic, and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
b. SSL Certificate:
An SSL certificate is installed on the web server to enable HTTPS encryption.
It ensures secure communication between the client's browser and the web server, protecting sensitive information from interception or tampering.
c. Monitoring Clients:
Monitoring clients are installed on each server to collect performance metrics, logs, and other relevant data.
They send this data to a central monitoring service (e.g., Sumo Logic) for analysis and visualization.
Specifics:
Why Firewalls?: Firewalls add an additional layer of security by controlling traffic based on predefined rules, preventing unauthorized access and protecting against various cyber threats.
HTTPS Traffic: Serving traffic over HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the communication.
Monitoring Purpose: Monitoring is used to track the health, performance, and security of the infrastructure and applications.
Data Collection: Monitoring tools collect data through agents installed on servers, APIs, logs, and other sources. This data is then processed, analyzed, and presented to administrators for insights and decision-making.
Monitoring Web Server QPS:
To monitor the web server's Query Per Second (QPS), you can:
Configure the monitoring client to collect metrics related to web server performance, such as requests per second.
Use monitoring tools to visualize and analyze the collected data, identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the web server's QPS.
Set up alerts to notify administrators when the QPS exceeds predefined thresholds, indicating potential performance issues or spikes in traffic.
Issues:
Terminating SSL at Load Balancer: Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, increasing the risk of data interception or tampering.
Single MySQL Server for Writes: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure for write operations, risking data loss or downtime in case of server failure.
Uniform Servers: Having servers with identical components (database, web server, and application server) may lead to a lack of diversity in the infrastructure, increasing vulnerability to common mode failures or attacks targeting specific components. Introducing diversity in server configurations can enhance fault tolerance and resilience.
